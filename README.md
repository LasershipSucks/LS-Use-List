# Who
LaserShip.  You may know them from having a package delivered a week after when it was supposed to be, or having fresh food that was supposed to be delivered next day be delivered three days late.  They are a "regional" delivery company, in that depending on where you live they may or may not be a carrier.

[This article from Freightwaves](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/long-controversial-and-now-cooking-lasership-rides-the-parcel-delivery-wave) does a great job on explaining what they are.

# What

This list will seek to capture every company that uses LaserShip, so you can choose whether or not to avoid them.  Your humble author is trying to avoid every company that uses LaserShip in my area, and this includes buying from them in a brick and mortar capacity.  Some people can't do that, and it is understandable.  Your mileage may vary.

# Where
Currently this list resides on GitHub.  Future iterations may be elsewhere. The [@LasershipS Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/LasershipS) will have the canonical pointer to this data.

As for where LaserShip operates, a TODO is to create a list of where they operate based on [Their independent contractor hiring page](https://lasership.com/drivers/).

# When
Updates to this doc this document will occur based on a few things:
* Confirmation that a company is using LaserShip in some capacity
* Someone reaching out on the [@LasershipS Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/LasershipS) to offer up new information
* Pull requests that seem sane (Adding or removing)

# Why
Lasership, in a multitude of interactions across a vast number of people, has been absolutely horrible to work with.  Their customer service doesn't particularly care, and the levers of change at a managerial level to make things better don't care either.  It stands to reason that by refusing to work with companies that work with LaserShip, companies will stop working with them.

# How
If you're looking for recourse, your options are limited, and some are more powerful methods of recourse than others.

1. Reach out to your local news organizations.  Local TV loves to cover stuff like this because it makes them look like they are sticking up for the little guy.
2. File a complaint with your state's Attorney General, which you can find in [This convenient list](https://www.naag.org/find-my-ag/).
3. File a complaint with the [Better Business Bureau](https://www.bbb.org/).
4. File a report with the [Federal Trade Commission](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/#/).
5. We all know at this point that complaining about LaserShip to the retailers below doesn't help, but if you've purchased from them, do it anyway.  Complain.  Keep complaining.  Demand to speak to supervisors.  Demand to speak to their supervisors.  Go on LinkedIn, find the people who make decisions at that company, and complain to them too.
6. File a chargeback with your bank, credit card company, or payment processor (E.G.: Paypal).  Time limits vary from place to place (Though these time limits are often extended when goods are not received), so get on it ASAP.
7. A a final step, stop shopping with firms that use Lasership entirely.  These firms do not care about you or your experiences.  If they did, it stands to reason, they would take action against egregious claims made against Lasership and dump them as a logistics partner.  What they care about is your money.  What this means is if you give up on online orders and still shop with them, they will keep using Lasership.  Send a clear message with your hard-earned money and time.
