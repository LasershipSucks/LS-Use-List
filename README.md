# Who
LaserShip.  You may know them from having a package delivered a week after when it was supposed to be, or having fresh food that was supposed to be delivered next day be delivered three days late.  They are a "regional" delivery company, in that depending on where you live they may or may not be a carrier.

[This article from Freightwaves](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/long-controversial-and-now-cooking-lasership-rides-the-parcel-delivery-wave) does a great job on explaining what they are.

# What

This list will seek to capture every company that uses LaserShip, so you can choose whether or not to avoid them.  Your humble author is trying to avoid every company that uses LaserShip in my area, and this includes buying from them in a brick and mortar capacity.  Some people can't do that, and it is understandable.  Your mileage may vary.

# Where
Currently this list resides on GitHub.  Future iterations may be elsewhere. The [@LasershipS Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/LasershipS) will have the canonical pointer to this data.

As for where LaserShip operates, a TODO is to create a list of where they operate based on [Their independent contractor hiring page](https://lasership.com/drivers/).

# When
Updates to this doc this document will occur based on a few things:
* Confirmation that a company is using LaserShip in some capacity
* Someone reaching out on the [@LasershipS Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/LasershipS) to offer up new information
* Pull requests that seem sane (Adding or removing)

# Why
Lasership, in a multitude of interactions across a vast number of people, has been absolutely horrible to work with.  Their customer service doesn't particularly care, and the levers of change at a managerial level to make things better don't care either.  It stands to reason that by refusing to work with companies that work with LaserShip, companies will stop working with them.
